/**
 * The SLRCommand class tries to make your life a whole lot easier when you would like 
 * to create new commands for your camera. 
 * 
 * E.g. one default command implemented with this is the take image cycle. 
 * This is a lot of work because you need to do all the following: 
 * - tell the camera to take an image
 * - test if the image was actually taken, e.g. if autofocus failed or flash wasn't loaded
 * - wait for the notification from the camera that the file was stored 
 * - transfer the image to the disk
